MongoDb 

Is a NoSQL database with JSON storage architecture
Client (browser) => communicates with the server (node) which 
uses mongoose to communicate with MongoDb

//command to start mongoDB it must be run with cmder from the data folder in the root of the computer.
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="c:\data\db"

After this it tells you the port in the end

collections and records: 

you can have multiple databases with different models each. Each model contains a collection of data 
conformed by records. They are stored as JSON objects. The architecture of each record is 
known as schema

find (criteria) returns all the records it matches.
fineOne('criteria) returns the first record it finds

both are used directly on the models, unlike save() that can be used in the instance of a model

example:
myChar = new MarioChar({name: 'Mario'});
myChar.save();

MarioChar.find({name: 'Mario'});

deleting records heheh
ex: 
char.remove();
MarioChar.remove();
MarioChar.findOneAndRemove();

updating records

mongoose methods: 

char.update();
MarioChar.update();
MarioChar.findOneAndUpdate();

Update Operators
 go to mongoDB Update operators 

Relational database

with mongo db this can be done as a collection of records withing the same model. 
No need to separate data in two different databases;

{
      name: 'Patrick',
      age: 38,
      books: [
            {title: 'Name of the wind', pages: 400}
            {title: 'Tigers of the snow', pages: 500}
      ]
}
